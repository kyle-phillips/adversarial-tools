# adversarial-tools

This is a [working list](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kyle-phillips/adversarial-tools/blob/main/adversarial-tools.html) of nearly 75 common tactics and techniques (primarily LOLBins) used by adversaries in a cyber attack.  

The creation of this list was born out of a desire to know what executables are running in our environment that we'd want to know about.  Use this list for threat hunting or incident response.  

This list contains both LOLbins and software tools.
