# adversarial-tools

This is a working list of tools that would potentially be used by adversaries in a cyber attack.  

The creation of this list was born out of a desire to know if certain executables are being used within an infrastructure that would not normally be seen.   Thus the intent is to compile a list of executable and script names that can be used for querying logs as a threat hunting activity.  

This list contains LOL Bins, and other software.
